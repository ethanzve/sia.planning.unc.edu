India has rejected and denied those claims.<\/p>\n<p>In May, Modi said peace on India\u2019s border with China is essential for normal relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Since coming to power in 2014, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of Modi has pumped millions of dollars to boost military and civilian infrastructure along its 3,800-km (2,360-mile) frontier with China.<\/p>\n<p>Separately, Gandhi blamed Modi for India\u2019s religious polarization, saying his Hindu nationalist party was not inclusive.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey sort of generate a certain amount of hatred in society, they polarize society and they are not inclusive. They don\u2019t embrace everybody, and they divide society,\u201d Gandhi said.<\/p>\n<p>The BJP denies the allegations and says its policies are aimed at the welfare and development of all Indians.<\/p>\n<p>Gandhi also accused the BJP of \u201ccapture of institutions\u201d and \u201ccapture of the press\u201d in India. Since Modi came to power in 2014, India has slid from 140th in World Press Freedom Index, an annual ranking by non-profit Reporters Without Borders, to 161st this year, its lowest ever.<\/p>\n<p>The BJP denies institutional compromise and says its governance abides by the rule of law.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s handling of relations with China, saying Beijing was \u201coccupying our territory,\u201d while also taking a dig at the Hindu nationalist leader over the country\u2019s religious polarization. \u201cThe fact of the matter is China is occupying our territory.
